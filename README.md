CRUD Operations for UCP Admin Portal using PHP

In the "ucpadminportal" project, I implemented CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using PHP. These operations allow administrators to manage data efficiently within the portal. The PHP backend interacts with a MySQL database, providing a robust and scalable solution for handling administrative tasks.

Key Features:

    Create: Admins can add new records to the database, such as user accounts, content, or configuration settings.
    Read: The portal retrieves and displays data from the database in a structured format, allowing admins to view details of users, reports, or other essential data.
    Update: Existing records can be modified through the portal, enabling admins to keep information up-to-date.
    Delete: Admins have the ability to remove outdated or irrelevant records from the database, maintaining data integrity and relevance.

The implementation ensures secure data handling with validation, sanitization, and prepared statements to protect against common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection
